## 🎥 Option 2: Automatic Camera Detection (Requires Models)

### **For automatic facial emotion detection:**

**Step 1: Download Models**

The camera button is stuck on "Loading..." because the face-api.js models aren't downloaded yet.

**Quick Download:**
```bash
# Create models folder
mkdir public\models

# Download these 4 files from:
# https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/face-api.js/tree/master/weights

# Required files:
1. tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
2. tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
3. face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json
4. face_expression_model-shard1
```

**Step 2: Place Files**
```
d:\MindMate\
└── public\
    └── models\
        ├── tiny_face_detector_model-weights_manifest.json
        ├── tiny_face_detector_model-shard1
        ├── face_expression_model-weights_manifest.json
        └── face_expression_model-shard1
```

**Step 3: Refresh Browser**
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
- Camera button should now say "✨ Enable Camera" instead of "Loading..."
